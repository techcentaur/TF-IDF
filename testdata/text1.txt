MANY YEARS LATER as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aureliano Buendía was to
remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice. At that time
Macondo was a village of twenty adobe houses, built on the bank of a river of clear water
that ran along a bed of polished stones, which were white and enormous, like prehistoric
eggs. The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate
them it was necessary to point. Every year during the month of March a family of ragged
gypsies would set up their tents near the village, and with a great uproar of pipes and
kettledrums they would display new inventions. First they brought the magnet. A heavy
gypsy with an untamed beard and sparrow hands, who introduced himself as Melquíades,
put on a bold public demonstration of what he himself called the eighth wonder of the
learned alchemists of Macedonia. He went from house to house dragging two metal
ingots and everybody was amazed to see pots, pans, tongs, and braziers tumble down
from their places and beams creak from the desperation of nails and screws trying to
emerge, and even objects that had been lost for a long time appeared from where they had
been searched for most and went dragging along in turbulent confusion behind
Melquíades’ magical irons. “Things have a life of their own,” the gypsy proclaimed with
a harsh accent. “It’s simply a matter of waking up their souls.” José Arcadio Buendía,
whose unbridled imagination always went beyond the genius of nature and even beyond
miracles and magic, thought that it would be possible to make use of that useless
invention to extract gold from the bowels of the earth. Melquíades, who was an honest
man, warned him: “It won’t work for that.” But José Arcadio Buendía at that time did not
believe in the honesty of gypsies, so he traded his mule and a pair of goats for the two
magnetized ingots. Úrsula Iguarán, his wife, who relied on those animals to increase their
poor domestic holdings, was unable to dissuade him. “Very soon well have gold enough
and more to pave the floors of the house,” her husband replied. For several months he
worked hard to demonstrate the truth of his idea. He explored every inch of the region, 
even the riverbed, dragging the two iron ingots along and reciting Melquíades’
incantation aloud. The only thing he succeeded in doing was to unearth a suit of fifteenthcentury armor which had all of its pieces soldered together with rust and inside of which
there was the hollow resonance of an enormous stone-filled gourd. When José Arcadio
Buendía and the four men of his expedition managed to take the armor apart, they found
inside a calcified skeleton with a copper locket containing a woman’s hair around its
neck.
 In March the gypsies returned. This time they brought a telescope and a magnifying
glass the size of a drum, which they exhibited as the latest discovery of the Jews of
Amsterdam. They placed a gypsy woman at one end of the village and set up the
telescope at the entrance to the tent. For the price of five reales, people could look into
the telescope and see the gypsy woman an arm’s length away. “Science has eliminated
distance,” Melquíades proclaimed. “In a short time, man will be able to see what is
happening in any place in the world without leaving his own house.” A burning noonday
sun brought out a startling demonstration with the gigantic magnifying glass: they put a
pile of dry hay in the middle of the street and set it on fire by concentrating the sun’s
rays. José Arcadio Buendía, who had still not been consoled for the failure of big
magnets, conceived the idea of using that invention as a weapon of war. Again
Melquíades tried to dissuade him, but he finally accepted the two magnetized ingots and
three colonial coins in exchange for the magnifying glass. Úrsula wept in consternation.
That money was from a chest of gold coins that her father had put together ova an entire
life of privation and that she had buried underneath her bed in hopes of a proper occasion
to make use of it. José Arcadio Buendía made no at. tempt to console her, completely
absorbed in his tactical experiments with the abnegation of a scientist and even at the risk
of his own life. In an attempt to show the effects of the glass on enemy troops, he
exposed himself to the concentration of the sun’s rays and suffered burns which turned
into sores that took a long time to heal. Over the protests of his wife, who was alarmed at
such a dangerous invention, at one point he was ready to set the house on fire. He would
spend hours on end in his room, calculating the strategic possibilities of his novel weapon
until he succeeded in putting together a manual of startling instructional clarity and an
irresistible power of conviction. He sent it to the government, accompanied by numerous 
descriptions of his experiments and several pages of explanatory sketches; by a
messenger who crossed the mountains, got lost in measureless swamps, forded stormy
rivers, and was on the point of perishing under the lash of despair, plague, and wild
beasts until he found a route that joined the one used by the mules that carried the mail.
In spite of the fact that a trip to the capital was little less than impossible at that time, José
Arcadio Buendía promised to undertake it as soon as the government ordered him to so
that he could put on some practical demonstrations of his invention for the military
authorities and could train them himself in the complicated art of solar war. For several
years he waited for an answer. Finally, tired of waiting, he bemoaned to Melquíades the
failure of his project and the gypsy then gave him a convincing proof of his honesty: he
gave him back the doubloons in exchange for the magnifying glass, and he left him in
addition some Portuguese maps and several instruments of navigation. In his own
handwriting he set down a concise synthesis of the studies by Monk Hermann. which he
left José Arcadio so that he would be able to make use of the astrolabe, the compass, and
the sextant. José Arcadio Buendía spent the long months of the rainy season shut up in a
small room that he had built in the rear of the house so that no one would disturb his
experiments. Having completely abandoned his domestic obligations, he spent entire
nights in the courtyard watching the course of the stars and he almost contracted
sunstroke from trying to establish an exact method to ascertain noon. When he became an
expert in the use and manipulation of his instruments, he conceived a notion of space that
allowed him to navigate across unknown seas, to visit uninhabited territories, and to
establish relations with splendid beings without having to leave his study. That was the
period in which he acquired the habit of talking to himself, of walking through the house
without paying attention to anyone, as Úrsula and the children broke their backs in the
garden, growing banana and caladium, cassava and yams, ahuyama roots and eggplants.
Suddenly, without warning, his feverish activity was interrupted and was replaced by a
kind of fascination. He spent several days as if he were bewitched, softly repeating to
himself a string of fearful conjectures without giving credit to his own understanding.
Finally, one Tuesday in December, at lunchtime, all at once he released the whole weight
of his torment. The children would remember for the rest of their lives the august 
solemnity with which their father, devastated by his prolonged vigil and by the wrath of
his imagination, revealed his discovery to them:
 “The earth is round, like an orange.”
 Úrsula lost her patience. “If you have to go crazy, please go crazy all by yourself!” she
shouted. “But don’t try to put your gypsy ideas into the heads of the children.” José
Arcadio Buendía, impassive, did not let himself be frightened by the desperation of his
wife, who, in a seizure of rage, mashed the astrolabe against the floor. He built another
one, he gathered the men of the village in his little room, and he demonstrated to them,
with theories that none of them could understand, the possibility of returning to where
one had set out by consistently sailing east. The whole village was convinced that José
Arcadio Buendía had lost his reason, when Melquíades returned to set things straight. He
gave public praise to the intelligence of a man who from pure astronomical speculation
had evolved a theory that had already been proved in practice, although unknown in
Macondo until then, and as a proof of his admiration he made him a gift that was to have
a profound influence on the future of the village: the laboratory of an alchemist.
 By then Melquíades had aged with surprising rapidity. On his first trips he seemed to be
the same age as José Arcadio Buendía. But while the latter had preserved his
extraordinary strength, which permitted him to pull down a horse by grabbing its ears, the
gypsy seemed to have been worn dowse by some tenacious illness. It was, in reality, the
result of multiple and rare diseases contracted on his innumerable trips around the world.
According to what he himself said as he spoke to José Arcadio Buendía while helping
him set up the laboratory, death followed him everywhere, sniffing at the cuffs of his
pants, but never deciding to give him the final clutch of its claws. He was a fugitive from
all the plagues and catastrophes that had ever lashed mankind. He had survived pellagra
in Persia, scurvy in the Malayan archipelago, leprosy in Alexandria, beriberi in Japan,
bubonic plague in Madagascar, an earthquake in Sicily, and a disastrous shipwreck in the
Strait of Magellan. That prodigious creature, said to possess the keys of Nostradamus,
was a gloomy man, enveloped in a sad aura, with an Asiatic look that seemed to know
what there was on the other side of things. He wore a large black hat that looked like a
raven with widespread wings, and a velvet vest across which the patina of the centuries
had skated. But in spite of his immense wisdom and his mysterious breadth, he had a 
human burden, an earthly condition that kept him involved in the small problems of daily
life. He would complain of the ailments of old age, he suffered from the most
insignificant economic difficulties, and he had stopped laughing a long time back because
scurvy had made his teeth drop out. On that suffocating noontime when the gypsy
revealed his secrets, José Arcadio Buendía had the certainty that it was the beginning of a
great friendship. The children were startled by his fantastic stories. Aureliano, who could
not have been more than five at the time, would remember him for the rest of his life as
he saw him that afternoon, sitting against the metallic and quivering light from the
window, lighting up with his deep organ voice the darkest reaches of the imagination,
while down over his temples there flowed the grease that was being melted by the heat.
José Arcadio, his older brother, would pass on that wonderful image as a hereditary
memory to all of his descendants. Úrsula on the other hand, held a bad memory of that
visit, for she had entered the room just as Melquíades had carelessly broken a flask of
bichloride of mercury.
 “It’s the smell of the devil,” she said.
 “Not at all,” Melquíades corrected her. “It has been proven that the devil has sulphuric
properties and this is just a little corrosive sublimate.”
 Always didactic, he went into a learned exposition of the diabolical properties of
cinnabar, but Úrsula paid no attention to him, although she took the children off to pray.
That biting odor would stay forever in her mind linked to the memory of Melquíades.
 The rudimentary laboratory—in addition to a profusion of pots, funnels, retorts, filters,
and sieves—was made up of a primitive water pipe, a glass beaker with a long, thin neck,
a reproduction of the philosopher’s egg, and a still the gypsies themselves had built in
accordance with modern descriptions of the three-armed alembic of Mary the Jew. Along
with those items, Melquíades left samples of the seven metals that corresponded to the
seven planets, the formulas of Moses and Zosimus for doubling the quantity of gold, and
a set of notes and sketches concerning the processes of the Great Teaching that would
permit those who could interpret them to undertake the manufacture of the philosopher’s
stone. Seduced by the simplicity of the formulas to double the quantity of gold, José
Arcadio Buendía paid court to Úrsula for several weeks so that she would let him dig up
her colonial coins and increase them by as many times as it was possible to subdivide 
mercury. Úrsula gave in, as always, to her husband’s unyielding obstinacy. Then José
Arcadio Buendía threw three doubloons into a pan and fused them with copper filings,
orpiment, brimstone, and lead. He put it all to boil in a pot of castor oil until he got a
thick and pestilential syrup which was more like common caramel than valuable gold. In
risky and desperate processes of distillation, melted with the seven planetary metals,
mixed with hermetic mercury and vitriol of Cyprus, and put back to cook in hog fat for
lack of any radish oil, Úrsula’s precious inheritance was reduced to a large piece of burnt
hog cracklings that was firmly stuck to the bottom of the pot.
