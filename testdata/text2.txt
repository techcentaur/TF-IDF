WHEN THE PIRATE Sir Francis Drake attacked Riohacha in the sixteenth century,
Úrsula Iguarán’s great-great-grandmother became so frightened with the ringing of alarm
bells and the firing of cannons that she lost control of her nerves and sat down on a
lighted stove. The burns changed her into a useless wife for the rest of her days. She
could only sit on one side, cushioned by pillows, and something strange must have
happened to her way of walking, for she never walked again in public. She gave up all
kinds of social activity, obsessed with the notion that her body gave off a singed odor.
Dawn would find her in the courtyard, for she did not dare fall asleep lest she dream of
the English and their ferocious attack dogs as they came through the windows of her
bedroom to submit her to shameful tortures with their red-hot irons. Her husband, an
Aragonese merchant by whom she had two children, spent half the value of his store on
medicines and pastimes in an attempt to alleviate her terror. Finally he sold the business
and took the family to live far from the sea in a settlement of peaceful Indians located in
the foothills, where he built his wife a bedroom without windows so that the pirates of
her dream would have no way to get in.
 In that hidden village there was a native-born tobacco planter who had lived there for
some time, Don José Arcadio Buendía, with whom Úrsula’s great-great-grandfather
established a partnership that was so lucrative that within a few years they made a
fortune. Several centuries later the great-great-grandson of the native-born planter
married the great-great-granddaughter of the Aragonese. Therefore, every time that
Úrsula became exercised over her husband’s mad ideas, she would leap back over three
hundred years of fate and curse the day that Sir Francis Drake had attacked Riohacha. It
was simply a way. of giving herself some relief, because actually they were joined till
death by a bond that was more solid that love: a common prick of conscience. They were
cousins. They had grown up together in the old village that both of their ancestors, with
their work and their good habits, had transformed into one of the finest towns in the
province. Although their marriage was predicted from the time they had come into the
world, when they expressed their desire to be married their own relatives tried to stop it.
They were afraid that those two healthy products of two races that had interbred over the 
centuries would suffer the shame of breeding iguanas. There had already been a horrible
precedent. An aunt of Úrsula’s, married to an uncle of José Arcadio Buendía, had a son
who went through life wearing loose, baggy trousers and who bled to death after having
lived forty-two years in the purest state of virginity, for he had been born and had grown
up with a cartilaginous tail in the shape of a corkscrew and with a small tuft of hair on the
tip. A pig’s tail that was never allowed to be seen by any woman and that cost him his life
when a butcher friend did him the favor of chopping it off with his cleaver. José Arcadio
Buendía, with the whimsy of his nineteen years, resolved the problem with a single
phrase: “I don’t care if I have piglets as long as they can talk.” So they were married
amidst a festival of fireworks and a brass band that went on for three days. They would
have been happy from then on if Úrsula’s mother had not terrified her with all manner of
sinister predictions about their offspring, even to the extreme of advising her to refuse to
consummate the marriage. Fearing that her stout and willful husband would rape her
while she slept, Úrsula, before going to bed, would put on a rudimentary kind of drawers
that her mother had made out of sailcloth and had reinforced with a system of
crisscrossed leather straps and that was closed in the front by a thick iron buckle. That
was how they lived for several months. During the day he would take care of his fighting
cocks and she would do frame embroidery with her mother. At night they would wrestle
for several hours in an anguished violence that seemed to be a substitute for the act of
love, until popular intuition got a whiff of something irregular and the rumor spread that
Úrsula was still a virgin a year after her marriage because her husband was impotent. José
Arcadio Buendía was the last one to hear the rumor.
 “Look at what people are going around saying, Úrsula,” he told his wife very calmly.
 “Let them talk,” she said. “We know that it’s not true.”
 So the situation went on the same way for another six months until that tragic Sunday
when José Arcadio Buendía won a cockfight from Prudencio Aguilar. Furious, aroused
by the blood of his bird, the loser backed away from José Arcadio Buendía so that
everyone in the cockpit could hear what he was going to tell him.
 “Congratulations!” he shouted. “Maybe that rooster of yours can do your wife a favor.”
 José Arcadio Buendía serenely picked up his rooster. “I’ll be right back,” he told
everyone. And then to Prudencio Aguilar:
 “You go home and get a weapon, because I’m going to kill you.”
 Ten minutes later he returned with the notched spear that had belonged to his
grandfather. At the door to the cockpit, where half the town had gathered, Prudencio
Aguilar was waiting for him. There was no time to defend himself. José Arcadio
Buendía’s spear, thrown with the strength of a bull and with the same good aim with
which the first Aureliano Buendía had exterminated the jaguars in the region, pierced his
throat. That night, as they held a wake over the corpse in the cockpit, José Arcadio
Buendía went into the bedroom as his wife was putting on her chastity pants. Pointing the
spear at her he ordered: “Take them off.” Úrsula had no doubt about her husband’s
decision. “You’ll be responsible for what happens,” she murmured. José Arcadio Buendía
stuck the spear into the dirt floor.
 “If you bear iguanas, we’ll raise iguanas,” he said. “But there’ll be no more killings in
this town because of you.”
 It was a fine June night, cool and with a moon, and they were awake and frolicking in
bed until dawn, indifferent to the breeze that passed through the bedroom, loaded with the
weeping of Prudencio Aguilar’s kin.
 The matter was put down as a duel of honor, but both of them were left with a twinge in
their conscience. One night, when she could not sleep, Úrsula went out into the courtyard
to get some water and she saw Prudencio Aguilar by the water jar. He was livid, a sad
expression on his face, trying to cover the hole in his throat with a plug made of esparto
grass. It did not bring on fear in her, but pity. She went back to the room and told her
husband what she had seen, but he did not think much of it. “This just means that we
can’t stand the weight of our conscience.” Two nights later Úrsula saw Prudencio Aguilar
again, in the bathroom, using the esparto plug to wash the clotted blood from his throat.
On another night she saw him strolling in the rain. José Arcadio Buendía, annoyed by his
wife’s hallucinations, went out into the courtyard armed with the spear. There was the
dead man with his sad expression.
 “You go to hell,” José Arcadio Buendía shouted at him. “Just as many times as you
come back, I’ll kill you again.”
 Prudencio Aguilar did not go away, nor did José Arcadio Buendía dare throw the spear.
He never slept well after that. He was tormented by the immense desolation with which 
the dead man had looked at him through the rain, his deep nostalgia as he yearned for
living people, the anxiety with which he searched through the house looking for some
water with which to soak his esparto plug. “He must be suffering a great deal,” he said to
Úrsula. “You can see that he’s so very lonely.” She was so moved that the next time she
saw the dead man uncovering the pots on the stove she understood what he was looking
for, and from then on she placed water jugs all about the house. One night when he found
him washing his wound in his own room, José Anedio Buendía could no longer resist.
 “It’s all right, Prudencio,” he told him. “We’re going to leave this town, just as far
away as we can go, and we’ll never come back. Go in peace now.”
 That was how they undertook the crossing of the mountains. Several friends of José
Arcadio Buendía, young men like him, excited, by the adventure, dismantled their houses
and packed up, along with their wives and children, to head toward the land that no one
had promised them. Before he left, José Arcadio Buendía buried the spear in the
courtyard and, one after the other, he cut the throats of his magnificent fighting cocks,
trusting that in that way he could give some measure of peace to Prudencio Aguilar. All
that Úrsula took along were a trunk with her bridal clothes, a few household utensils, and
the small chest with the gold pieces that she had inherited from her father. They did not
lay out any definite itinerary. They simply tried to go in a direction opposite to the road to
Riohacha so that they would not leave any trace or meet any people they knew. It was an
absurd journey. After fourteen months, her stomach corrupted by monkey meat and snake
stew, Úrsula gave birth to a son who had all of his features human. She had traveled half
of the trip in a hammock that two men carried on their shoulders, because swelling had
disfigured her legs and her varicose veins had puffed up like bubbles. Although it was
pitiful to see them with their sunken stomachs and languid eyes, the children survived the
journey better than their parents, and most of the time it was fun for them. One morning,
after almost two years of crossing, they became the first mortals to see the western slopes
of the mountain range. From the cloudy summit they saw the immense aquatic expanse of
the great swamp as it spread out toward the other side of the world. But they never found
the sea. One night, after several months of lost wandering through the swamps, far away
now from the last Indians they had met on their way, they camped on the banks of a stony
river whose waters were like a torrent of frozen glass. Years later, during the second civil 
war, Colonel Aureliano Buendía tried to follow that same route in order to take Riohacha
by surprise and after six days of traveling he understood that it was madness.
Nevertheless, the night on which they camped beside the river, his father’s host had the
look of shipwrecked people with no escape, but their number had grown during the
crossing and they were all prepared (and they succeeded) to die of old age. José Arcadio
Buendía dreamed that night that right there a noisy city with houses having mirror wails
rose up. He asked what city it was and they answered him with a name that he had never
heard, that had no meaning at all, but that had a supernatural echo in his dream:
Macondo. On the following day he convinced his men that they would never find the sea.
He ordered them to cut down the trees to make a clearing beside the river, at the coolest
spot on the bank, and there they founded the village.
 José Arcadio Buendía did not succeed in deciphering the dream of houses with mirror
walls until the day he discovered ice. Then he thought he understood its deep meaning.
He thought that in the near future they would be able to manufacture blocks of ice on a
large scale from such a common material as water and with them build the new houses of
the village. Macondo would no longer be a burning place, where the hinges and door
knockers twisted with the heat, but would be changed into a wintry city. If he did not
persevere in his attempts to build an ice factory, it was because at that time he was
absolutely enthusiastic over the education of his sons, especially that of Aureliano, who
from the first had revealed a strange intuition for alchemy. The laboratory had been
dusted off. Reviewing Melquíades’ notes, serene now, without the exaltation of novelty,
in prolonged and patient sessions they tried to separate Úrsula’s gold from the debris that
was stuck to the bottom of the pot. Young José Arcadio scarcely took part in the process.
While his father was involved body and soul with his water pipe, the willful first-born,
who had always been too big for his age, had become a monumental adolescent. His
voice had changed. An incipient fuzz appeared on his upper lip. One night, as Úrsula
went into the room where he was undressing to go to bed, she felt a mingled sense of
shame and pity: he was the first man that she had seen naked after her husband, and he
was so well-equipped for life that he seemed abnormal. Úrsula, pregnant for the third
time, relived her newlywed terror.
