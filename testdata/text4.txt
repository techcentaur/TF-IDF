PILAR TERNERA’S son was brought to his grand parents’ house two weeks after he
was born. Úrsula admitted him grudgingly, conquered once more by the obstinacy of her
husband, who could not tolerate the idea that an offshoot of his blood should be adrift,
but he imposed the condition that the child should never know his true identity. Although
he was given the name José Arcadio, they ended up calling him simply Arcadio so as to
avoid confusion. At that time there was so much activity in the town and so much bustle
in the house that the care of the children was relegated to a secondary level. They were
put in the care of Visitación, a Guajiro Indian woman who had arrived in town with a
brother in flight from a plague of insomnia that had been scourging their tribe for several
years. They were both so docile and willing to help that Úrsula took them on to help her
with her household chores. That was how Arcadio and Amaranta came to speak the
Guajiro language before Spanish, and they learned to drink lizard broth and eat spider
eggs without Úrsula’s knowing it, for she was too busy with a promising business in
candy animals. Macondo had changed. The people who had come with Úrsula spread the
news of the good quality of its soil and its privileged position with respect to the swamp,
so that from the narrow village of past times it changed into an active town with stores
and workshops and a permanent commercial route over which the first Arabs arrived with
their baggy pants and rings in their ears, swapping glass beads for macaws. José Arcadio
Buendía did not have a moment’s rest. Fascinated by an immediate reality that came to be
more fantastic than the vast universe of his imagination, he lost all interest in the
alchemist’s laboratory, put to rest the material that had become attenuated with months of
manipulation, and went back to being the enterprising man of earlier days when he had
decided upon the layout of the streets and the location of the new houses so that no one
would enjoy privileges that everyone did not have. He acquired such authority among the
new arrivals that foundations were not laid or walls built without his being consulted, and
it was decided that he should be the one in charge of the distribution of the land. When
the acrobat gypsies returned, with their vagabond carnival transformed now into a
gigantic organization of games of luck and chance, they were received with great joy, for
it was thought that José Arcadio would be coming back with them. But José Arcadio did 
not return, nor did they come with the snake-man, who, according to what Úrsula
thought, was the only one who could tell them about their son, so the gypsies were not
allowed to camp in town or set foot in it in the future, for they were considered the
bearers of concupiscence and perversion. José Arcadio Buendía, however, was explicit in
maintaining that the old tribe of Melquíades, who had contributed so much to the growth
of the village with his age-old wisdom and his fabulous inventions, would always find the
gates open. But Melquíades’ tribe, according to what the wanderers said, had been wiped
off the face of the earth because they had gone beyond the limits of human knowledge.
 Emancipated for the moment at least from the torment of fantasy, José Arcadio Buendía
in a short time set up a system of order and work which allowed for only one bit of
license: the freeing of the birds, which, since the time of the founding, had made time
merry with their flutes, and installing in their place musical clocks in every house. They
were wondrous clocks made of carved wood, which the Arabs had traded for macaws and
which José Arcadio Buendía had synchronized with such precision that every half hour
the town grew merry with the progressive chords of the same song until it reached the
climax of a noontime that was as exact and unanimous as a complete waltz. It was also
José Arcadio Buendía who decided during those years that they should plant almond trees
instead of acacias on the streets, and who discovered, without ever revealing it, a way to
make them live forever. Many years later, when Macondo was a field of wooden houses
with zinc roofs, the broken and dusty almond trees still stood on the oldest streets,
although no one knew who had planted them. While his father was putting the town in
order and his mother was increasing their wealth with her marvelous business of candied
little roosters and fish, which left the house twice a day strung along sticks of balsa wood,
Aureliano spent interminable hours in the abandoned laboratory, learning the art of
silverwork by his own experimentation. He had shot up so fast that in a short time the
clothing left behind by his brother no longer fit him and he began to wear his father’s, but
Visitación had to sew pleats in the shirt and darts in the pants, because Aureliano had not
sequined the corpulence of the others. Adolescence had taken away the softness of his
voice and had made him silent and definitely solitary, but, on the other hand, it had
restored the intense expression that he had had in his eyes when he was born. He
concentrated so much on his experiments in silverwork that he scarcely left the laboratory 
to eat. Worried ever his inner withdrawal, José Arcadio Buendía gave him the keys to the
house and a little money, thinking that perhaps he needed a woman. But Aureliano spent
the money on muriatic acid to prepare some aqua regia and he beautified the keys by
plating them with gold. His excesses were hardly comparable to those of Arcadio and
Amaranta, who had already begun to get their second teeth and still went about all day
clutching at the Indians’ cloaks, stubborn in their decision not to speak Spanish but the
Guajiro language. “You shouldn’t complain.” Úrsula told her husband. “Children inherit
their parents’ madness.” And as she was lamenting her misfortune, convinced that the
wild behavior of her children was something as fearful as a pig’s tail, Aureliano gave her
a look that wrapped her in an atmosphere of uncertainty.
 “Somebody is coming,” he told her.
 Úrsula, as she did whenever he made a prediction, tried to break it down with her
housewifely logic. It was normal for someone to be coming. Dozens of strangers came
through Macondo every day without arousing suspicion or secret ideas. Nevertheless,
beyond all logic, Aureliano was sure of his prediction.
 “I don’t know who it will be,” he insisted, “but whoever it is is already on the way.”
 That Sunday, in fact, Rebeca arrived. She was only eleven years old. She had made the
difficult trip from Manaure with some hide dealers who had taken on the task of
delivering her along with a letter to José Arcadio Buendía, but they could not explain
precisely who the person was who had asked the favor. Her entire baggage consisted of a
small trunk, a little rocking chair with small hand-painted flowers, and a canvas sack
which kept making a cloc-cloc-cloc sound, where she carried her parents’ bones. The
letter addressed to José Arcadio Buendía was written is very warm terms by someone
who still loved him very much in spite of time and distance, and who felt obliged by a
basic humanitarian feeling to do the charitable thing and send him that poor unsheltered
orphan, who was a second cousin of Úrsula’s and consequently also a relative of José
Arcadio Buendía, although farther removed, because she was the daughter of that
unforgettable friend Nicanor Ulloa and his very worthy wife Rebeca Montiel, may God
keep them in His holy kingdom, whose remains the girl was carrying so that they might
be given Christian burial. The names mentioned, as well as the signature on the letter,
were perfectly legible, but neither José Arcadio, Buendía nor Úrsula remembered having 
any relatives with those names, nor did they know anyone by the name of the sender of
the letter, much less the remote village of Manaure. It was impossible to obtain any
further information from the girl. From the moment she arrived she had been sitting in the
rocker, sucking her finger and observing everyone with her large, startled eyes without
giving any sign of understanding what they were asking her. She wore a diagonally
striped dress that had been dyed black, worn by use, and a pair of scaly patent leather
boots. Her hair was held behind her ears with bows of black ribbon. She wore a scapular
with the images worn away by sweat, and on her right wrist the fang of a carnivorous
animal mounted on a backing of copper as an amulet against the evil eye. Her greenish
skin, her stomach, round and tense as a drum. revealed poor health and hunger that were
older than she was, but when they gave her something to eat she kept the plate on her
knees without tasting anything. They even began to think that she was a deaf-mute until
the Indians asked her in their language if she wanted some water and she moved her eyes
as if she recognized them and said yes with her head.
