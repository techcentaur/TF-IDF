Around that time a merry, foul-mouthed, provocative woman came to the house to help
with the chorea, and she knew how to read the future in cards. Úrsula spoke to her about
her son. She thought that his disproportionate size was something as unnatural as her
cousin’s tail of a pig. The woman let out an expansive laugh that resounded through the
house like a spray of broken glass. “Just the opposite,” she said. “He’ll be very lucky.” In
order to confirm her prediction she brought her cards to the house a few days later and
locked herself up with José Arcadio in a granary off the kitchen. She calmly placed her
cards on an old carpenter’s bench. saying anything that came into her head, while the boy
waited beside her, more bored than intrigued. Suddenly she reached out her hand and
touched him. “Lordy!” she said, sincerely startled, and that was all she could say. José
Arcadio felt his bones filling up with foam, a languid fear, and a terrible desire to weep.
The woman made no insinuations. But José Arcadio kept looking for her all night long,
for the smell of smoke that she had under her armpits and that had got caught under his
skin. He wanted to be with her all the time, he wanted her to be his mother, for them
never to leave the granary, and for her to say “Lordy!” to him. One day he could not
stand it any more and. he went looking for her at her house: He made a formal visit,
sitting uncomprehendingly in the living room without saying a word. At that moment he
had no desire for her. He found her different, entirely foreign to the image that her smell
brought on, as if she were someone else. He drank his coffee and left the house in
depression. That night, during the frightful time of lying awake, he desired her again with
a brutal anxiety, but he did not want her that time as she had been in the granary but as
she had been that afternoon.
 Days later the woman suddenly called him to her house, where she was alone with her
mother, and she had him come into the bedroom with the pretext of showing him a deck
of cards. Then she touched him with such freedom that he suffered a delusion after the
initial shudder, and he felt more fear than pleasure. She asked him to come and see her
that night. He agreed. in order to get away, knowing that he was incapable of going. But
that night, in his burning bed, he understood that he had to go we her, even if he were not
capable. He got dressed by feel, listening in the dark to his brother’s calm breathing, the
dry cough of his father in the next room, the asthma of the hens in the courtyard, the buzz
of the mosquitoes, the beating of his heart, and the inordinate bustle of a world that he 
had not noticed until then, and he went out into the sleeping street. With all his heart he
wanted the door to be barred and not just closed as she had promised him. But it was
open. He pushed it with the tips of his fingers and the hinges yielded with a mournful and
articulate moan that left a frozen echo inside of him. From the moment he entered,
sideways and trying not to make a noise, he caught the smell. He was still in the hallway,
where the woman’s three brothers had their hammocks in positions that he could not see
and that he could not determine in the darkness as he felt his way along the hall to push
open the bedroom door and get his bearings there so as not to mistake the bed. He found
it. He bumped against the ropes of the hammocks, which were lower than he had
suspected, and a man who had been snoring until then turned in his sleep and said in a
kind of delusion, “It was Wednesday.” When he pushed open the bedroom door, he could
not prevent it from scraping against the uneven floor. Suddenly, in the absolute darkness,
he understood with a hopeless nostalgia that he was completely disoriented. Sleeping in
the narrow room were the mother, another daughter with her husband and two children,
and the woman, who may not have been there. He could have guided himself by the smell
if the smell had not been all over the house, so devious and at the same time so definite,
as it had always been on his skin. He did not move for a long time, wondering in fright
how he had ever got to that abyss of abandonment, when a hand with all its fingers
extended and feeling about in the darkness touched his face. He was not surprised, for
without knowing, he had been expecting it. Then he gave himself over to that hand, and
in a terrible state of exhaustion he let himself be led to a shapeless place where his
clothes were taken off and he was heaved about like a sack of potatoes and thrown from
one side to the other in a bottomless darkness in which his arms were useless, where it no
longer smelled of woman but of ammonia, and where he tried to remember her face and
found before him the face of Úrsula, confusedly aware that he was doing something that
for a very long time he had wanted to do but that he had imagined could really never be
done, not knowing what he was doing because he did not know where his feet were or
where his head was, or whose feet or whose head, and feeling that he could no longer
resist the glacial rumbling of his kidneys and the air of his intestines, and fear, and the
bewildered anxiety to flee and at the same time stay forever in that exasperated silence
and that fearful solitude.
 Her name was Pilar Ternera. She had been part of the exodus that ended with the
founding of Macondo, dragged along by her family in order to separate her from the man
who had raped her at fourteen and had continued to love her until she was twenty-two,
but who never made up his mind to make the situation public because he was a man
apart. He promised to follow her to the ends of the earth, but only later on, when he put
his affairs in order, and she had become tired of waiting for him, always identifying him
with the tall and short, blond and brunet men that her cards promised from land and sea
within three days, three months, or three years. With her waiting she had lost the strength
of her thighs, the firmness of her breasts, her habit of tenderness, but she kept the
madness of her heart intact. Maddened by that prodigious plaything, José Arcadio
followed her path every night through the labyrinth of the room. On a certain occasion he
found the door barred, and he knocked several times, knowing that if he had the boldness
to knock the first time he would have had to knock until the last, and after an
interminable wait she opened the door for him. During the day, lying down to dream, he
would secretly enjoy the memories of the night before. But when she came into the
house, merry, indifferent, chatty, he did not have to make any effort to hide his tension,
because that woman, whose explosive laugh frightened off the doves, had nothing to do
with the invisible power that taught him how to breathe from within and control his
heartbeats, and that had permitted him to understand why man are afraid of death. He was
so wrapped up in himself that he did not even understand the joy of everyone when his
father and his brother aroused the household with the news that they had succeeded in
penetrating the metallic debris and had separated Úrsula’s gold.
 They had succeeded, as a matter of fact, after putting in complicated and persevering
days at it. Úrsula was happy, and she even gave thanks to God for the invention of
alchemy, while the people of the village crushed into the laboratory, and they served
them guava jelly on crackers to celebrate the wonder, and José Arcadio Buendía let them
see the crucible with the recovered gold, as if he had just invented it. Showing it all
around, he ended up in front of his older son, who during the past few days had barely put
in an appearance in the laboratory. He put the dry and yellowish mass in front of his eyes
and asked him: “What does it look like to you?” José Arcadio answered sincerely:
 “Dog shit.”
 His father gave him a blow with the back of his hand that brought out blood and tears.
That night Pilar Ternera put arnica compresses on the swelling, feeling about for the
bottle and cotton in the dark, and she did everything she wanted with him as long as it did
not bother him, making an effort to love him without hurting him. They reached such a
state of intimacy that later, without realizing it, they were whispering to each other.
 “I want to be alone with you,” he said. “One of these days I’m going to tell everybody
and we can stop all of this sneaking around.”
 She did not try to calm him down.
 “That would be fine,” she said “If we’re alone, we’ll leave the lamp lighted so that we
can see each other, and I can holler as much as I want without anybody’s having to butt
in, and you can whisper in my ear any crap you can think of.”
 That conversation, the biting rancor that he felt against his father, and the imminent
possibility of wild love inspired a serene courage in him. In a spontaneous way, without
any preparation, he told everything to his brother.
 At first young Aureliano understood only the risk, the immense possibility of danger
that his brother’s adventures implied, and he could not understand the fascination of the
subject. Little by little he became contaminated with the anxiety. He wondered about the
details of the dangers, he identified himself with the suffering and enjoyment of his
brother, he felt frightened and happy. He would stay awake waiting for him until dawn in
the solitary bed that seemed to have a bottom of live coals, and they would keep on
talking until it was time to get up, so that both of them soon suffered from the same
drowsiness, felt the same lack of interest in alchemy and the wisdom of their father, and
they took refuge in solitude. “Those kids are out of their heads,” Úrsula said. “They must
have worms.” She prepared a repugnant potion for them made out of mashed wormseed,
which they both drank with unforeseen stoicism, and they sat down at the same time on
their pots eleven times in a single day, expelling some rose-colored parasites that they
showed to everybody with great jubilation, for it allowed them to deceive Úrsula as to the
origin of their distractions and drowsiness. Aureliano not only understood by then, he
also lived his brother’s experiences as something of his own, for on one occasion when
the latter was explaining in great detail the mechanism of love, he interrupted him to ask:
“What does it feel like?” José Arcadio gave an immediate reply:
 “It’s like an earthquake.”
 One January Thursday at two o’clock in the morning, Amaranta was born. Before
anyone came into the room, Úrsula examined her carefully. She was light and watery,
like a newt, but all of her parts were human: Aureliano did not notice the new thing
except when the house became full of people. Protected by the confusion, he went off in
search of his brother, who had not been in bed since eleven o’clock, and it was such an
impulsive decision that he did not even have time to ask himself how he could get him
out of Pilar Ternera’s bedroom. He circled the house for several hours, whistling private
calls, until the proximity of dawn forced him to go home. In his mother’s room, playing
with the newborn little sister and with a face that drooped with innocence, he found José
Arcadio
